# Python-Assignment-Adrija-Guha
"python_assignment_Adrija" is the file containing the code to the solution. <br>
I have just rearranged the input excel sheets (<em>Input1 and input2</em>) as per requirement in order to read data.<br>
Pandas is used to read data from the excel sheets and output can be simply printed on the console as the code is run.<br>
A screen shot of the output on cosole is as attached below.<br><br>
